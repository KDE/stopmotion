WHAT IS THIS
------------
The stop motion project is a project to create a program to
create stop motion animations. The program is aimed at students
at primary and secondary schools, and will be distributed 
through the Skolelinux/Debian-edu distribution of GNU/Linux.


INSTALLATION
------------
If you run Debian the easiest way to install this program is to
add this line to your sources.list file:

deb http://www.skolelinux.no/~bjoern/debian/ unstable main

Then run 'apt-get update' and 'apt-get install stopmotion'.

If you do not run Debian you have to compile the program from source.
We have not focused on getting the configure script as good as it
should be; you will not get any error message if you do not have
the necessary libraries installed. This will hopefully be fixed
later. 

However, the libraries needed to build the program is:
	- Qt3 (of course), the configure script checks for this
	- libtar
	- SDL
	- SDL_image
	- libXML2
	- vorbis
	- vorbisfile
	- FAM/Gamin

After you have ensured that these libraries are installed, you can
run ./configure and make.

Please send me a bug report <bjoern.nilsen@hig.no> if there are things 
that I have not included in this document.
