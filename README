DEVELOPMENT
-----------

After qmake, the following make targets are available:

make           # build a release version of the project, called stopmotion
make debug     # build a debug version of the project, called stopmotion-d
make all       # build both debug and release versions
make test      # build and run the unit tests
make clean     # remove all build products
make install   # install stopmotion
make uninstall # remove installation

To install in a specific location:

qmake PREFIX=/specific/location HTML_PATH=/docs/go/here TRANSLATIONS_PATH=/translations/go/here
sudo make install

The defines are optional. PREFIX defaults to /usr/local.
HTML_PATH defaults to ${PREFIX}/share/doc/stopmotion/html.
TRANSLATIONS_PATH defaults to ${PREFIX}/share/doc/stopmotion/translations.

To put the files somewhere before copying them for installation (after qmake):

make INSTALL_ROOT=/somewhere/writeable install
cp -fr /somewhere/writeable/* /

PREFIX is where the files will ultimately end up. make install will put them in
$(INSTALL_ROOT)$(PREFIX)
