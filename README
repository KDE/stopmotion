WHAT IS THIS
------------
Stopmotion is a program to create stop motion animations.
See http://stopmotion.bjoernen.com for more info.


INSTALLATION
------------
1) ./configure
2) make
3) make install

The configure script will generate 'stopmotion.pro' and 'config.cpp' from 
'stopmotion.pro.in' and 'config.cpp.in', respectively. You can override the 
settings in these files, but ideally you should give all your settings through 
options to the configure script. See './configure --help' for more info.
 
You need the following libraries installed to compile:
    - Qt4
    - libtar
    - SDL
    - SDL_image
    - XML2
    - vorbisfile
    - FAM/Gamin
	- pkg-config
