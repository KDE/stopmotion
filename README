WHAT IS THIS
------------
Stopmotion is a program to create stop motion animations.
See http://linuxstopmotion.org for more info.


INSTALLATION

1) qmake
2) sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local install

You need the following libraries installed to compile:
    - Qt4
    - libtar
    - SDL
    - SDL_image
    - XML2
    - vorbisfile
    - FAM/Gamin
    - pkg-config

Your help is very much appreciated.

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

After qmake, the following make targets are available:

make       # build a release version of the project, called stopmotion
make debug # build a debug version of the project, called stopmotion-d
make all   # build both debug and release versions
make test  # build and run the unit tests
make clean # remove all build products

To install in a specific location (after qmake):

make PREFIX=/install/location all
make INSTALL_ROOT=/somewhere/writeable install
cp -fr /somewhere/writeable/* /install/location

or wrap it up in one line:

make PREFIX=/install/location INSTALL_ROOT=/install/location install

PREFIX must match where the files will ultimately end up. INSTALL_ROOT is
where make install will put them.
If PREFIX is not set in the invocation of make that does the compiles (make,
make release, make debug, or make install if none of the others have been
invoked before) then translations and help will not work.

To uninstall:

make INSTALL_ROOT=/install/location uninstall
