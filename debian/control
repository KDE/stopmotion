Description: program for creating stop motion animations
 You can create stop-motion animations with images grabbed
 from your favourite video device. You just sets stopmotion to
 use a grabber program which works with your device. It is also 
 possible to do the same with video export; just plug in an
 encoder capable of doing video export from couple of images.
 .
 Stopmotion has a set of tools which helps you creating the 
 movements smooth and precise.
